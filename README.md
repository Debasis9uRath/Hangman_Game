# Hangman_Game:
In this project we  built a Hangman game using Python.
Hangman is a word-guessing game. One player picks a secret word, and the other player tries to guess it.  
In this project first I have created a list of random words based on which the random words will be generated.
The used have to guess the word within the given number of chances to win the game.
